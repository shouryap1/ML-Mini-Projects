# Heart Failure Prediction Model
* The dataset was taken from Kaggle.



## ABOUT MODEL:

* This model takes different biological aspects in account to predict heart failure.
I used Function Transformer to remove skewness from the data so as to increase the accuracy of the model.
Apart from this, I also tried different algo and printed the accuracy given by them accordingly.

## HOW TO USE:

* Get all the files

* Install all the libraries used in the model.(mentioned in the first cell of .ipynb file)

* RUN all the cells.
